            <h3>What Is Safe Line?</h3>
            <p>Safe Line is a new app made for safety. Safe Line provides people with the help they need, when they need it. It will offer a quick emergency contact feature as well features that will help people find safe routes to take and watch areas of crime. Our goal is to prevent and lessen the chances of risks that people take when walking alone.</p>

            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p> Women ages 19-24 are at the greatest risk of nonfatal domestic violence, and women under 24 and under suffer the highest rates of rape. The Justice Department estimates that one in five women will experience rape or attempted rape during their college years and that less than five percent of these rapes will be reported.</p>
