            <h3>Processing Projects</h3>
            <p> While still using Processing 3, these projects were much more in depth and required a lot more attention! So the hamster project featured background music and a sound that played when the hamster was clicked! And the Missouri Farmers Market, was my data visualization project. I pulled data from a huuge spreadsheet and transferred it to this semi-interactive map!</p>
